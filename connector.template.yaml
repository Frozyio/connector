# Config validation

# Either join or auto_registration sections exist. If there are both or none
# then configuration is considered invalid.

# If auto_registration section exists then either auto_registration.provider
# or auto_registration.consumer section must exists. If there are both or none
# then configuration is considered invalid.

# join.token and auto_registration.access_token are so-called "secrets".
# They can be specified as literal strings (like in an example above), but they
# also support more complex specifications.
#
# If a secret is not a literal string it must be defined as YAML dictionary.
# That dictionary has one mandatory key - "origin". Other keys might (or might
# not) be required depending on a value of "origin". This value currently can
# only be 'gce_instance_metadata'. Like this:
#
# auto_registration:
#   access_token:
#     origin: gce_instance_metadata
#     attribute: "frozy-access-token"
#
# For each non-literal secret you can define a set of transformations. For
# instance, you might want to base64-decode a value and feed it into KMS
# decryption. This could be done like this:
#
# auto_registration:
#   access_token:
#     origin: gce_instance_metadata
#     attribute: "frozy-access-token"
#     transform:
#       - base64_decode
#       - type: google_kms_decrypt
#         key: projects/<your-project>/locations/<your-location>/keyRings/<your-key-ring>/cryptoKeys/<your-crypto-key>
#
